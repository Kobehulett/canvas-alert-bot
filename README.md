# Canvas Alert Bot

## What the Bot Does
this Discord bot conencts to canvas and autonomously checks for upcoming assignments 
it sends reminders and updates to a discord channel because Im often on discord and I often forget due dates 
I also used commands like "!ping" tp verify if the bot is online if it is it will respond with "pong".
you can also use commands like '!next' to see upcoming assignments.

## How to Run It
1. Add your Canvas and Discord credentials to a `.env` file:

2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the bot:

4. (Optional) Deploy on Render and add UptimeRobot to keep it running online.

## Why I Hosted It This Way
I wanted the bot to run 24/7 without paying for hosting.  
By using **Renderâ€™s free web service** and **UptimeRobot** to ping it every few minutes, the bot stays online permanently for free.
